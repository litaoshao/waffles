<h2>How to submit a bug report</h2>

<p>If you have a bug to report or a feature to request, please just send me an email. (My email address is on the main page.) I am aware that there are several good bug-tracking packages out there. If the volume of reported bugs starts to increase significantly, perhaps we will start using one of them. Until then, however, email seems to sufficient to meet our needs.
