<h2>Overview of Waffles</h2>

<p>This document provides a high-level overview of what is contained in the Waffles machine learning toolkit.</p>

<p>Waffles provides the following command-line applications, each containing several tools for performing machine learning operations:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>waffles_audio</b> contains tools for processing audio files.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_cluster</b> contains tools for clustering.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_dimred</b> contains tools for dimensionality reduction, attribute selection, etc.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_generate</b> contains tools to sample distributions, sample manifolds, and generate certain types of data.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_learn</b> contains tools for supervised learning.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_plot</b> contains tools for visualizing data.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_recommend</b> contains tools for collaborative filtering, recommendation systems, imputation, etc.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_sparse</b> contains tools to learning from sparse data, document classification, etc.</li>
	<li><b>waffles_transform</b> contains tools for manipulating data, shuffling rows, swapping columns, matrix operations, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For people who prefer not to have to remember commands, waffles also includes a graphical tool called
<ul>
	<li><b>waffles_wizard</b></li>
</ul>
. This application opens a web browser and guides the user through a series of forms to create a command that will perform the desired task. This provides all the convenience of a GUI interface, but without locking the user in. That is, since it generates a command-line command for you to use, it becomes easy to perform the same operations without the GUI. Thus, the Waffles tools are particularly well-suited for experiments that need to be automated.</p>

<p>All of the functionality of the waffles tools is provided in an object-oriented C++ class library called
<ul>
	<li><b>GClasses</b></li>
</ul>
. In other words, the command-line tools are just thin wrappers around functionality implemented in the GClasses library. Thus, if you find any of the operations performed by the Waffles command-line tools to be useful, it is easy to incorporate the same functionality into your C++ programs.</p>

Finally, in order to fully demonstrate how to use the GClasses library, several <a href="demos.html">demo applications</a> are also included with Waffles.</p>
