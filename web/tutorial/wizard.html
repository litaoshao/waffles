<h2>The waffles_wizard tool</h2>
<img src="wizard.png">
<p>The <i>waffles_wizard</i> tool is a graphical tool that helps the user to construct a command that will perform a desired task. It guides the user through menus and forms to let the user pick the tools and parameters necessary to accomplish some machine learning task.</p>

<p>To run this tool, just do
<pre>
	waffles_wizard
</pre>
or, if you use Windows, do
<pre>
	waffles_wizard.exe
</pre>

<p>After you run through the wizard forms, it will print a command to the screen. You can paste this command in to your shell, and it should perform the task you specified. (We think this approach is superior to making a graphical interface for our tools because it doesn't lock the user into the GUI. You can easily paste your commands into a script to automate your experiments.)</p>
