<h2>waffles_generate</h2>
<p>
	A command-line tool to help generate various types of data.
	(Most of the datasets it generates are for testing manifold learning
	algorithms. I add them as I need them.) Here's the usage information:</p>
<pre>
Full Usage Information
[Square brackets] are used to indicate required arguments.
&lt;Angled brackets&gt; are used to indicate optional arguments.

waffles_generate [command]
   Generate certain useful datasets
   crane &lt;options&gt;
      Generate a dataset where each row represents a ray-traced image of a
      crane with a ball.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -saveimage [filename]
            Save an image showing all the frames.
         -ballradius [size]
            Specify the size of the ball. The default is 0.3.
         -frames [horiz] [vert]
            Specify the number of frames to render.
         -size [wid] [hgt]
            Specify the size of each frame.

            green, blue) channel values.
   cube [n]
      returns data evenly distributed on the surface of a unit cube. Each side
      is sampled with [n]x[n] points. The total number of points in the dataset
      will be 6*[n]*[n]-12*[n]+8.

      Generates points that lie on an entwined spirals manifold.

            Specify a seed for the random number generator.
         -reduced
            Generate intrinsic values instead of extrinsic values. (This might
            be useful to empirically measure the accuracy of a manifold
            learner.)

         included. The manifold-defining equations must all have the same
         number of parameters. The parameters will be drawn from a standard
         normal distribution (from 0 to 1). Usually it is a good idea to wrap
         the equations in quotes. Example:
         "y1(x1,x2)=x1;y2(x1,x2)=sqrt(x1*x2);h(x)=sqrt(1-x);y3(x1,x2)=x2*x2-h(x

               A categorical distribution with 3 classes. [p0], [p1], and [p2]
               specify the probabilities of each of the 3 classes. (This is
               just an example. Other values besides 3 may be used for the
