<pre>
Full Usage Information
[Square brackets] are used to indicate required arguments.
&lt;Angled brackets&gt; are used to indicate optional arguments.

waffles_learn [command]
   Supervised learning, transduction, cross-validation, etc.
   autotune [dataset] &lt;data_opts&gt; [algname]
      Use cross-validation to automatically determine a good set of parameters
      for the specified algorithm with the specified data. The selected
      parameters are printed to stdout.
      [dataset]
         The filename of a dataset.
      &lt;data_opts&gt;
         -labels [attr_list]
            Specify which attributes to use as labels. (If not specified, the
            default is to use the last attribute for the label.) [attr_list] is
            a comma-separated list of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used
            to specify a range of columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to
            index from the right instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5"
            refers to columns 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last
            column. "0-*1" refers to all but the last column.
         -ignore [attr_list]
            Specify attributes to ignore. [attr_list] is a comma-separated list
            of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used to specify a range of
            columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to index from the right
            instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5" refers to columns 0, 2,
            3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last column. "0-*1" refers to all
            but the last column.
      [algname]
         The name of the algorithm that you wish to automatically tune.
         agglomerativetransducer
            An agglomerative transducer
         decisiontree
            A decision tree
         graphcuttransducer

         knn
            A k-nearest-neighbor instance-based learner
         meanmarginstree
            A mean margins tree
         neuralnet
            A feed-foward neural network (a.k.a. multi-layer perceptron)
         naivebayes
            A naive Bayes model
         naiveinstance
            A naive instance model
   train &lt;options&gt; [dataset] &lt;data_opts&gt; [algorithm]
      Trains a supervised learning algorithm. The trained model-file is printed
      to stdout. (Typically, you will want to pipe this to a file.)
      &lt;options&gt;
         -seed [value]
            Specify a seed for the random number generator. (Use this option to
            ensure that your results are reproduceable.)
         -calibrate
            Calibrate the model after it is trained, such that predicted
            distributions will approximate the distributions represented in the
            training data. This switch is typically used only if you plan to
            predict distributions (by calling predictdistribution) instead of
            just class labels or regression values. Calibration will not effect
            the predictions made by regular calls to 'predict', which is used
            by most other tools.
      [dataset]
         The filename of a dataset.
      &lt;data_opts&gt;
         -labels [attr_list]
            Specify which attributes to use as labels. (If not specified, the
            default is to use the last attribute for the label.) [attr_list] is
            a comma-separated list of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used
            to specify a range of columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to
            index from the right instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5"
            refers to columns 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last
            column. "0-*1" refers to all but the last column.
         -ignore [attr_list]
            Specify attributes to ignore. [attr_list] is a comma-separated list
            of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used to specify a range of
            columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to index from the right
            instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5" refers to columns 0, 2,
            3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last column. "0-*1" refers to all
            but the last column.
   predict &lt;options&gt; [model-file] [dataset] &lt;data_opts&gt;
      Predict labels for all of the patterns in [dataset]. Results are printed
      in the form of a ".arff" file (including both features and predictions)
      to stdout.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -seed [value]

            ensure that your results are reproduceable.)
      [model-file]

         the output when you trained a supervised learning algorithm.)
      [dataset]
         The filename of a dataset. (There should already be placeholder labels
         in this dataset. The placeholder labels will be replaced in the output
         by the labels that the model predicts.)
      &lt;data_opts&gt;
         -labels [attr_list]
            Specify which attributes to use as labels. (If not specified, the
            default is to use the last attribute for the label.) [attr_list] is
            a comma-separated list of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used
            to specify a range of columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to
            index from the right instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5"
            refers to columns 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last
            column. "0-*1" refers to all but the last column.
         -ignore [attr_list]
            Specify attributes to ignore. [attr_list] is a comma-separated list
            of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used to specify a range of
            columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to index from the right

            3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last column. "0-*1" refers to all
            but the last column.
   predictdistribution &lt;options&gt; [model-file] [data-set] &lt;data_opts&gt; [pattern]
      Predict a distribution for a single feature vector and print it to
      stdout. (Typically, the '-calibrate' switch should be used when training
      the model. If the model is not calibrated, then the predicted
      distribution may not be a very good estimated distribution. Also, some
      models cannot be used to predict a distribution.)
      &lt;options&gt;
         -seed [value]

         the output when you trained a supervised learning algorithm.)
      [data-set]
         The filename of dataset from which to obtain meta-data. This can be
         the training set or the test set. It doesn't matter which, because the

         attribute values, are obtained from this dataset.
      [pattern]
         A list of feature values separated by spaces. (A "?" may be used for
         unknown feature values if the model supports using unknown feature
         values.)
      &lt;data_opts&gt;
         -labels [attr_list]

            to specify a range of columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to
            index from the right instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5"
            refers to columns 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last
            column. "0-*1" refers to all but the last column.

            but the last column.
   test &lt;options&gt; [model-file] [dataset] &lt;data_opts&gt;

      for each dimension in the label vector. Predictive accuracy is reported
      for nominal label dimensions, and mean-squared-error is reported for
      continuous label dimensions.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -seed [value]

      Predict labels for [unlabeled-set] based on the examples in
      [labeled-set]. For most algorithms, this is the same as training on
      [labeled-set] and then predicting labels for [unlabeled-set]. Some
      algorithms, however, have no models. These can transduce, even though

            default is to use the last attribute for the label.) [attr_list] is
            a comma-separated list of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used
            to specify a range of columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to
            index from the right instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5"
            refers to columns 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last
            column. "0-*1" refers to all but the last column.
         -ignore [attr_list]
            Specify attributes to ignore. [attr_list] is a comma-separated list
            of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used to specify a range of
            columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to index from the right
            instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5" refers to columns 0, 2,
            3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last column. "0-*1" refers to all
            but the last column.

      &lt;options&gt;
         -seed [value]
            Specify a seed for the random number generator. (Use this option to
            ensure that your results are reproduceable.)
         -labeldims [n]
            Specify the number of dimensions in the label (output) vector. The
            default is 1. (Don't confuse this with the number of class labels.
            It only takes one dimension to specify a class label, even if there
            are k possible labels.)
         -reps [n]
            Specify the number of reps to perform. More reps means it will take
            longer, but results will be more accurate. The default is 5.
         -samples [n]
            Specify the granularity at which to measure recall. If not
            specified, the default is 100.

      &lt;data_opts&gt;
         -labels [attr_list]

            default is to use the last attribute for the label.) [attr_list] is
            a comma-separated list of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used
            to specify a range of columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to
            index from the right instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5"
            refers to columns 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last
            column. "0-*1" refers to all but the last column.
         -ignore [attr_list]
            Specify attributes to ignore. [attr_list] is a comma-separated list
            of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used to specify a range of
            columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to index from the right
            instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5" refers to columns 0, 2,
            3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last column. "0-*1" refers to all
            but the last column.
   sterilize &lt;options&gt; [dataset] &lt;data_opts&gt; [algorithm]
      Perform cross-validation to generate a new dataset that contains only the
      correctly-classified instances. The new sterilized data is printed to
      stdout.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -seed [value]
            Specify a seed for the random number generator. (Use this option to
            ensure that your results are reproduceable.)
         -folds [n]
            Specify the number of cross-validation folds to perform.
         -diffthresh [d]
            Specify a threshold of absolute difference for continuous labels.
            Predictions with an absolute difference less than this threshold
            are considered to be "correct".
      [dataset]
         The filename of a dataset to sterilize.
      &lt;data_opts&gt;
         -labels [attr_list]
            Specify which attributes to use as labels. (If not specified, the
            default is to use the last attribute for the label.) [attr_list] is
            a comma-separated list of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used
            to specify a range of columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to
            index from the right instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5"

            of zero-indexed columns. A hypen may be used to specify a range of
            columns.  A '*' preceding a value means to index from the right
            instead of the left. For example, "0,2-5" refers to columns 0, 2,
            3, 4, and 5. "*0" refers to the last column. "0-*1" refers to all
            but the last column.
   trainrecurrent &lt;options&gt; [method] [obs-data] [action-data] [context-dims] [algorithm] [algorithm]
      Train a recurrent model of a dynamical system with the specified training
      [method]. The training data is specified by [obs-data], which specifies
      the sequence of observations, and [action-data], which specifies the
      sequence of actions. [context-dims] specifies the number of dimensions in
      the state-space of the system. The two algorithms specify the two
      functions of a model of a dynamical system. The first [algorithm] models
      the transition function. The second [algorithm] models the observation
      function.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -seed [value]
            Specify a seed for the random number generator. (Use this option to
            ensure that your results are reproduceable.)
         -paramdims 2 [wid] [hgt]
            If observations are images, use this option to parameterize the
            predictions, so only the channel values of each pixel are
            predicted. (Other values besides 2 dimensions are also supported.)
         -state [filename]
            Save the estimated state to the specified file. (Only has effect if
            moses is used as the training method.)
         -validate [interval] 1 [obs] [action]
            Perform validation at [interval]-second intervals with observation
            data, [obs], and action data, [action]. (Also supports more than 1
            validation sequence if desired.)
         -out [filename]
            Save the resulting model to the specified file. If not speicified,
            the default is "model.json".
         -noblur
            Do not use blurring. The default is to use blurring. Sometimes
            blurring improves results. Sometimes not.
         -traintime [seconds]
            Specify how many seconds to train the model. The default is 3600,
            which is 1 hour.
         -isomap
            Use Isomap instead of Breadth-first Unfolding if moses is used as
            the training method.
      [method]
         moses
            Use Temporal-NLDR to estimate state, then build the model using the
            state estimate.
         bptt [depth] [iters-per-grow-sequence]
            Backpropagation Through Time. [depth] specifies the number of
            instances of the transition function that will appear in the
            unfolded model. A good value might be 3. [iters-per-grow-sequence]
            specifies the number of pattern presentations before the sequence
            is incremented. A good value might be 50000.
         evolutionary
            Train with evoluationary optimization
         hillclimber
            Train with a hill-climbing algorithm.
         annealing [deviation] [decay] [window]
            Train with simulated annealing. Good values might be 2.0 0.5 300
   usage
      Print usage information.
[algorithm]
   A supervised learning algorithm, or a transductive algorithm.
   agglomerativetransducer
      A model-free transduction algorithm based on single-link agglomerative
      clustering. Unlabeled patterns take the label of the cluster with which
      they are joined. It never joins clusters with different labels.
   bag &lt;contents&gt; end
      A bagging (bootstrap aggregating) ensemble. This is a way to combine the
      power of many learning algorithms through voting. "end" marks the end of
      the ensemble contents. Each algorithm instance is trained using a
      training set created by drawing (with replacement) from the original data
      until the training set has the same number of instances as the original
      data.
      &lt;contents&gt;
         [instance_count] [algorithm]
            Specify the number of instances of a learning algorithm to add to
            the bagging ensemble.
   baseline
      This is one of the simplest of all supervised algorithms. It ignores all
      features. For nominal labels, it always predicts the most common class in
      the training set. For continuous labels, it always predicts the mean
      label in the training set. An effective learning algorithm should never
      do worse than baseline--hence the name "baseline".
   bucket &lt;contents&gt; end
      This uses cross-validation with the training set to select the best model
      from a bucket of models. When accuracy is measured across multiple
      datasets, it will usually do better than the best model in the bucket
      could do. "end" marks the end of the contents of the bucket.
      &lt;contents&gt;
         [algorithm]
            Add an algorithm to the bucket
   bma &lt;contents&gt; end
      A Bayesian model averaging ensemble. This trains each model after the
      manner of bagging, but then combines them weighted according to their
      probability given the data. Uniform priors are assumed.
      &lt;contents&gt;
         [instance_count] [algorithm]
            Specify the number of instances of a learning algorithm to add to
            the BMA ensemble.
   bmc &lt;options&gt; &lt;contents&gt; end
      A Bayesian model combination ensemble. This algorithm is described in
      Monteith, Kristine and Carroll, James and Seppi, Kevin and Martinez,
      Tony, Turning Bayesian Model Averaging into Bayesian Model Combination,
      Proceedings of the IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks
      IJCNN'11, 2657--2663, 2011.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -samples [n]
            Specify the number of samples to draw from the simplex of possible
            ensemble combinations. (Larger values result in better accuracy
            with the cost of more computation.)
      &lt;contents&gt;
         [instance_count] [algorithm]
            Specify the number of instances of a learning algorithm to add to
            the BMA ensemble.
   boost &lt;options&gt; [algorithm]
      Uses AdaBoost to create an ensemble that may be more accurate than a lone
      instance of the specified algorithm.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -trainratio [value]
            When approximating the weighted training set by resampling, use a
            sample of size [value]*training_set_size
         -size [n]
            The number of base learners to use in the ensemble.
   cvdt [n]
      This is a bucket of two bagging ensembles: one with [n] entropy-reducing
      decision trees, and one with [n] meanmarginstrees. (This algorithm is
      specified in Gashler, Michael S. and Giraud-Carrier, Christophe and
      Martinez, Tony. Decision Tree Ensemble: Small Heterogeneous Is Better
      Than Large Homogeneous. In The Seventh International Conference on
      Machine Learning and Applications, Pages 900 - 905, ICMLA '08. 2008)
   decisiontree &lt;options&gt;
      A decision tree.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -autotune
            Automatically determine a good set of parameters for this model
            with the current data.
         -random [draws]
            Use random divisions (instead of divisions that reduce entropy).
            Random divisions make the algorithm train faster, and also increase
            model variance, so it is better suited for ensembles, but random
            divisions also make the decision tree more vulnerable to problems
            with irrelevant features. [draws] is typically 1, but if you
            specify a larger value, it will pick the best out of the specified
            number of random draws.
         -leafthresh [n]
            When building the tree, if the number of samples is &lt;= this value,
            it will stop trying to divide the data and will create a leaf node.
            The default value is 1. For noisy data, larger values may be
            advantageous.
         -maxlevels [n]
            When building the tree, if the depth (the length of the path from
            the root to the node currently being formed, including the root and
            the currently forming node) is [n], it will stop trying to divide
            the data and will create a leaf node.  This means that there will
            be at most [n]-1 splits before a decision is made.  This crudely
            limits overfitting, and so can be helpful on small data sets.  It
            can also make the resulting trees easier to interpret.  If set to
            0, then there is no maximum (which is the default).
   graphcuttransducer &lt;options&gt;
      This is a model-free transduction algorithm. It uses a min-cut/max-flow
      graph-cut algorithm to separate each label from all of the others.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -autotune
            Automatically determine a good set of parameters for this model
            with the current data.
         -neighbors [k]
            Set the number of neighbors to connect with each point in order to
            form the graph.
   knn &lt;options&gt;
      The k-Nearest-Neighbor instance-based learning algorithm. It uses
      Euclidean distance for continuous features and Hamming distance for
      nominal features.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -autotune
            Automatically determine a good set of parameters for this model
            with the current data.
         -neighbors [k]
            Specify the number of neighbors, k, to use.
         -equalweight
            Give equal weight to every neighbor. (The default is to use linear
            weighting for continuous features, and sqared linear weighting for
            nominal features.
         -scalefeatures
            Use a hill-climbing algorithm on the training set to scale the
            feature dimensions in order to give more accurate results. This
            increases training time, but also improves accuracy and robustness
            to irrelevant features.
         -pearson
            Use Pearson's correlation coefficient to evaluate the similarity
            between sparse vectors. (Only compatible with sparse training.)
         -cosine
            Use the cosine method to evaluate the similarity between sparse
            vectors. (Only compatible with sparse training.)
   linear
      A linear regression model
   meanmarginstree
      This is a very simple oblique (or linear combination) tree. (This
      algorithm is specified in Gashler, Michael S. and Giraud-Carrier,
      Christophe and Martinez, Tony. Decision Tree Ensemble: Small
      Heterogeneous Is Better Than Large Homogeneous. In The Seventh
      International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, Pages 900
      - 905, ICMLA '08. 2008)
   naivebayes &lt;options&gt;
      The naive Bayes learning algorithm.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -autotune
            Automatically determine a good set of parameters for this model
            with the current data.
         -ess [value]
            Specifies an equivalent sample size to prevent unsampled values
            from dominating the joint distribution. Good values typically range
            between 0 and 1.5.
   naiveinstance &lt;options&gt;
      This is an instance learner that assumes each dimension is conditionally
      independant from other dimensions. It lacks the accuracy of knn in low
      dimensional feature space, but scales much better to high dimensionality.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -autotune
            Automatically determine a good set of parameters for this model
            with the current data.
         -neighbors [k]
            Set the number of neighbors to use in each dimension
   neighbortransducer &lt;options&gt;
      This is a model-free transduction algorithm. It is an instance learner
      that propagates labels where the neighbors are most in agreement. This
      algorithm does well when classes sample a manifold (such as with text
      recognition).
      &lt;options&gt;
         -autotune
            Automatically determine a good set of parameters for this model
            with the current data.
         -neighbors [k]
            Set the number of neighbors to use with each point
   neuralnet &lt;options&gt;
      A single or multi-layer feed-forward neural network (a.k.a. multi-layer
      perceptron). It can be trained with online backpropagation (Rumelhart,
      D.E., Hinton, G.E., and Williams, R.J. Learning representations by
      back-propagating errors. Nature, 323:9, 1986.), or several other
      optimization methods.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -autotune
            Automatically determine a good set of parameters (including number
            of layers, hidden units, learning rate, etc.) for this model with
            the current data.
         -addlayer [size]
            Add a hidden layer with "size" logisitic units to the network. You
            may use this option multiple times to add multiple layers. The
            first layer added is adjacent to the input features. The last layer
            added is adjacent to the output labels. If you don't add any hidden
            layers, the network is just a single layer of sigmoid units.
         -learningrate [value]
            Specify a value for the learning rate. The default is 0.1
         -momentum [value]
            Specifies a value for the momentum. The default is 0.0
         -windowepochs [value]
            Specifies the number of training epochs that are performed before
            the stopping criteria is tested again. Bigger values will result in
            a more stable stopping criteria. Smaller values will check the
            stopping criteria more frequently.
         -minwindowimprovement [value]
            Specify the minimum improvement that must occur over the window of
            epochs for training to continue. [value] specifies the minimum
            decrease in error as a ratio. For example, if value is 0.02, then
            training will stop when the mean squared error does not decrease by
            two percent over the window of epochs. Smaller values will
            typically result in longer training times.
         -holdout [portion]
            Specify the portion of the data (between 0 and 1) to use as a
            hold-out set for validation. That is, this portion of the data will
            not be used for training, but will be used to determine when to
            stop training. If the holdout portion is set to 0, then no holdout
            set will be used, and the entire training set will be used for
            validation (which may lead to long training time and overfit).
         -dontsquashoutputs
            Don't squash the outputs values with the logistic function. Just
            report the net value at the output layer. This is often used for
            regression.
         -crossentropy
            Use cross-entropy instead of squared-error for the error signal.
         -activation [func]
            Specify the activation function to use with all subsequently added
            layers. (For example, if you add this option after all of the
            -addlayer options, then the specified activation function will only
            apply to the output layer. If you add this option before all of the
            -addlayer options, then the specified activation function will be
            used in all layers. It is okay to use a different activation
            function with each layer, if you want.)
            logistic
               The logistic sigmoid function. (This is the default activation
               function.)
            arctan
               The arctan sigmoid function.
            tanh
               The hyperbolic tangeant sigmoid function.
            algebraic
               An algebraic sigmoid function.
            identity
               The identity function. This activation function is used to
               create a layer of linear perceptrons. (For regression problems,
               it is common to use this activation function on the output
               layer.)
            bidir
               A sigmoid-shaped function with a range from -inf to inf. It
               converges at both ends to -sqrt(-x) and sqrt(x). This activation
               function is designed to be used on the output layer with
               regression problems intead of identity.
            gaussian
               A gaussian activation function
            sinc
               A sinc wavelet activation function
   randomforest [trees] &lt;options&gt;
      A baggging ensemble of decision trees that use random division
      boundaries. (This algorithm is described in Breiman, Leo (2001). Random
      Forests. Machine Learning 45 (1): 5-32. doi:10.1023/A:1010933404324.)
      [trees]
         Specify the number of trees in the random forest
      &lt;options&gt;
         -samples [n]
            Specify the number of randomly-drawn attributes to evaluate. The
            one that maximizes information gain will be chosen for the decision
            boundary. If [n] is 1, then the divisions are completely random.
            Larger values will decrease the randomness.
