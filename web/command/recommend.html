   usage
      Print usage information.
[collab-filter]
   A collaborative-filtering recommendation algorithm.
   bag &lt;contents&gt; end
      A bagging (bootstrap aggregating) ensemble. This is a way to combine the
      power of collaborative filtering algorithms through voting. "end" marks
      the end of the ensemble contents. Each collaborative filtering algorithm
      instance is trained on a subset of the original data, where each
      expressed element is given a probability of 0.5 of occurring in the
      training set.
      &lt;contents&gt;
         [instance_count] [collab-filter]
            Specify the number of instances of a collaborative filtering
            algorithm to add to the bagging ensemble.
   baseline
      A very simple recommendation algorithm. It always predicts the average
      rating for each item. This algorithm is useful as a baseline algorithm
      for comparison.
   clusterdense [n] &lt;options&gt;
      A collaborative-filtering algorithm that clusters users based on a dense
      distance metric with k-means, and then makes uniform recommendations
      within each cluster.
      [n]
         The number of clusters to use.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -norm [l]
            Specify the norm for the L-norm distance metric to use.
         -missingpenalty [d]
            Specify the difference to use in the distance computation when a
            value is missing from one or both of the vectors.
   clustersparse [n] &lt;options&gt;
      A collaborative-filtering algorithm that clusters users based on a sparse
      similarity metric with k-means, and then makes uniform recommendations
      within each cluster.
      [n]
         The number of clusters to use.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -pearson
            Use Pearson Correlation to compute the similarity between users.
            (The default is to use the cosine method.)
   instance [k] &lt;options&gt;
      An instance-based collaborative-filtering algorithm that makes
      recommendations based on the k-nearest neighbors of a user.
      [k]
         The number of neighbors to use.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -pearson
            Use Pearson Correlation to compute the similarity between users.
            (The default is to use the cosine method.)
         -regularize [value]
            Add [value] to the denominator in order to regularize the results.
            This ensures that recommendations will not be dominated when a
            small number of overlapping items occurs. Typically, [value] will
            be a small number, like 0.5 or 1.5.
   matrix [intrinsic] &lt;options&gt;
      A matrix factorization collaborative-filtering algorithm. (Implemented
      according to the specification on page 631 in Takacs, G., Pilaszy, I.,
      Nemeth, B., and Tikk, D. Scalable collaborative filtering approaches for
      large recommender systems. The Journal of Machine Learning Research,
      10:623-656, 2009. ISSN 1532-4435., except with the addition of
      learning-rate decay and a different stopping criteria.)
      [intrinsic]
         The number of intrinsic (or latent) feature dims to use to represent
         each user's preferences.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -regularize [value]
            Specify a regularization value. Typically, this is a small value.
            Larger values will put more pressure on the system to use small
            values in the matrix factors.
   nlpca [intrinsic] &lt;options&gt;
      A non-linear PCA collaborative-filtering algorithm. This algorithm was
      published in Scholz, M. Kaplan, F. Guy, C. L. Kopka, J. Selbig, J.,
      Non-linear PCA: a missing data approach, In Bioinformatics, Vol. 21,
      Number 20, pp. 3887-3895, Oxford University Press, 2005. It uses a
      generalization of backpropagation to train a multi-layer perceptron to
      fit to the known ratings, and to predict unknown values.
      [intrinsic]
         The number of intrinsic (or latent) feature dims to use to represent
         each user's preferences.
      &lt;options&gt;
         -addlayer [size]
            Add a hidden layer with "size" logisitic units to the network. You
            may use this option multiple times to add multiple layers. The
            first layer added is adjacent to the input features. The last layer
            added is adjacent to the output labels. If you don't add any hidden
            layers, the network is just a single layer of sigmoid units.
         -learningrate [value]
            Specify a value for the learning rate. The default is 0.1
         -momentum [value]
            Specifies a value for the momentum. The default is 0.0
         -windowepochs [value]
            Specifies the number of training epochs that are performed before
            the stopping criteria is tested again. Bigger values will result in
            a more stable stopping criteria. Smaller values will check the
            stopping criteria more frequently.
         -minwindowimprovement [value]
            Specify the minimum improvement that must occur over the window of
            epochs for training to continue. [value] specifies the minimum
            decrease in error as a ratio. For example, if value is 0.02, then
            training will stop when the mean squared error does not decrease by
            two percent over the window of epochs. Smaller values will
            typically result in longer training times.
         -dontsquashoutputs
            Don't squash the outputs values with the logistic function. Just
            report the net value at the output layer. This is often used for
            regression.
         -crossentropy
            Use cross-entropy instead of squared-error for the error signal.
         -noinputbias
            Do not use an input bias.
         -nothreepass
            Use one-pass training instead of three-pass training.
         -activation [func]
            Specify the activation function to use with all subsequently added
            layers. (For example, if you add this option after all of the
            -addlayer options, then the specified activation function will only
            apply to the output layer. If you add this option before all of the
            -addlayer options, then the specified activation function will be
            used in all layers. It is okay to use a different activation
            function with each layer, if you want.)
            logistic
               The logistic sigmoid function. (This is the default activation
               function.)
            arctan
               The arctan sigmoid function.
            tanh
               The hyperbolic tangeant sigmoid function.
            algebraic
               An algebraic sigmoid function.
            identity
               The identity function. This activation function is used to
               create a layer of linear perceptrons. (For regression problems,
               it is common to use this activation function on the output
               layer.)
            bidir
               A sigmoid-shaped function with a range from -inf to inf. It
               converges at both ends to -sqrt(-x) and sqrt(x). This activation
               function is designed to be used on the output layer with
               regression problems intead of identity.
            gaussian
               A gaussian activation function
            sinc
               A sinc wavelet activation function
